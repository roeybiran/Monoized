**Pure Solarized** strives to faithfully implement Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme.

_Almost_ all the colors are unmodified from Schoonover's original specification. The base colors are employed according to the specification's recommendations.

The assignment of accent colors is more open to interpretation. But monotone, complementary, triadic, and tetradic colors are given more syntatic weight over complementary and analogous colors.

Both light and dark themes are included.
